# Prevent Misclicks
This plugin prevents you from certain misclicks, such as casting superglass make or the offering spells with a non-optimal inventory.

Note that the superglass make option will only work using Withdraw-X on sand, with it configured to 18 (or your number in the config) and Withdraw-1 on seaweed, requiring you to click it three times
