# PreventSGM
This plugin prevents you from casting superglass make. The default configuration is when you have 
3 giant seaweed and 18 buckets of sand. This can be changed to your liking. Plugin does not support
regular seaweed, but this can be added, but I don't really see why you should be using regular seaweed.

Note that this plugin will only work using Withdraw-X on sand, with it configured to 18 (or your number in the config) and Withdraw-1 on seaweed, requiring you to click it three times
